Title: Tools to fit a topic model using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and
    visualize the fitted model interactively using d3

Description: This package implements a Gibbs Sampler algorithm to fit a topic
    model to unstructured text data. It contains three basic groups of
    functions: (1) pre-processing of unstructured text, including
    substitutions, tokenization, stemming, and named entity tagging, (2)
    fitting the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model to training data
    and making model-based predictions on test data, and (3) visualizing and
    summarizing the fitted model.
